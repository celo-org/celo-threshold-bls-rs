# Distributed Key Generation CLI

This crate provides a CLI to the provided DKG. 

As explained in [`dkg-core`](../dkg-core), there are a few phases. For each phase, users perform some computation which is then published to a "board". An authenticated channel is assumed for publishing to the board. In this CLI, the board is assumed to be a smart contract on the Celo Blockchain. Before advancing to each of the next phases, the board gathers all participants' contributions and combines them in a data structure which gets downloaded from the chain. These contributions are then used by each participant in the next round.

## Participating in the DKG

Prerequisite: Building this binary requires having `Solc@0.6.6` available in your PATH. 
That can be done either by [installing the binary](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.6.6)
or using [`solc-select`](https://github.com/crytic/solc-select). Other methods can also be found
in the [Solidity docs](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing-solidity.html).


Install the DKG CLI with `cargo build --release`. 
We will use the Alfajores testnet for this example, which you can access by using `https://alfajores-forno.celo-testnet.org` as a `NODE_URL`. You can fund your account by inserting your `address` to the [Alfajores faucet](https://celo.org/developers/faucet).

1. `dkg-cli keygen --path ./keypair` 

This will generate your keypair. You should then fund the `address` with some CGLD 
to pay for transaction fees and send it to the DKG deployer, so that they allow 
you to participate in the DKG.

2. `dkg-cli run --node-url $NODE_URL -p $PRIVATE_KEY --contract-address $DKG_ADDRESS -o ./output`

Then you can leave the terminal open until completion. It will run the DKG and output
the shares and threshold public key at the `output` file in json format.

Example of successful output:

```
Success. Your share and threshold pubkey are ready.

## Commands

### Keypair generation

```

## Using Docker

A docker image of the CLI can be used instead via `docker run -ti kobigurk/celo-dkg`

NOTE: Docker is tricky to install on recent Fedora, but Podman works fine. The only changes needed are changing docker to podman, and adding a parameter to override SELinux for the mount: `podman run -ti --security-opt label=disable -v $PWD:/dkg kobigurk/celo-dkg`.
